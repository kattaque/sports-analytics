All my sports-related projects! 

### NHL ELO Ranking
The project I worked on over the summer in collaboration with the NHL and Carnegie Mellon's Department of Statistics. The project focused on creating a model that translated player performance across international ice hockey leagues, and was ultimately presented at the CMSAC2019 poster session. 

### NHL Contract 
Data and code for my Senior Honors Thesis. Focuses on the effect of the so called "contract curse" within the NHL and the causal relationship between number of years left on a contract has on individual player performance.
